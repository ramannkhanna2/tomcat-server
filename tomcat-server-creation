take centos 7 :
Install Apache Tomcat
Download tomcat packages from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi  onto /opt on EC2 instance
Note: Make sure you change <version> with the tomcat version which you download.

# Create tomcat directory
cd /opt
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.65/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.65.tar.gz
tar -xvzf /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>.tar.gz
yum install java -y
give executing permissions to startup.sh and shutdown.sh which are under bin.

chmod +x /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>/bin/startup.sh 
chmod +x /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>/bin/shutdown.sh
Note: you may get below error while starting tomcat incase if you dont install Java
Neither the JAVA_HOME nor the JRE_HOME environment variable is defined At least one of these environment variable is needed to run this program

create link files for tomcat startup.sh and shutdown.sh
ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup
ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown
tomcatup
Check point :
access tomcat application from browser on port 8080

http://<Public_IP>:8080
Using unique ports for each application is a best practice in an environment. But tomcat and Jenkins runs on ports number 8080. Hence lets change tomcat port number to 8090. Change port number in conf/server.xml file under tomcat home

cd /opt/apache-tomcat-<version>/conf
# update port number in the "connecter port" field in server.xml
# restart tomcat after configuration update
tomcatdown
tomcatup
Check point :
Access tomcat application from browser on port 8090

http://<Public_IP>:8090
now application is accessible on port 8090. but tomcat application doesnt allow to login from browser. changing a default parameter in context.xml does address this issue
#search for context.xml

if u click on manager app , u will get error ..., to resolve :
find / -name context.xml
above command gives 3 context.xml files. comment () Value ClassName field on files which are under webapp directory. After that restart tomcat services to effect these changes. At the time of writing this lecture below 2 files are updated.
/opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
/opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

to comment start with <!--    and end with -->

# Restart tomcat services
tomcatdown  
tomcatup
Update users information in the tomcat-users.xml file goto tomcat home directory and Add below users to conf/tomcat-users.xml file
  <role rolename="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>
Restart serivce and try to login to tomcat application from the browser. This time it should be Successful
